# STRUCTURE

All of our instant designs use straightforward structure under body element: header, main, and footer.
Note that, the structure is the decision to make Instant Designs easier to understand for as many website requirements as possible.
This structure is not definitive to how we can develop our page for further specific requirement.

## Header

This is where your logo, banner image, and main menu reside.
Header element will be the same across pages.

Main menu is the simple navigational links that visible for the visitors on the page.
Primary navigation is to make visitor in control of your website.

Mobile web make navigation to be visible on top of the page.

The navigation can be set with three options:
- Static, not follow scrolling
- Fixed, remain visible on scroll
- Fixed Up, Hidden on Scroll down, Visible on Scroll Up

We recommend to make clear distinct navigation for internal pages, to different subdomains, or to other domains.

## Main

This is where you will have all of the content including sections, hero section, article, and asides.
Unlinke Header or Footer, content of Main element differ from page to page.

## Footer

This is where technical information and footer menu reside.
Just link Header, Footer element will be the same across pages.
