# TO BUILD OR NO BUILD!?

In our definition, the goals of publishing static website is to have web pages serve directly by web server without processed by server side script.

This a problem since website is build with reusable components.

Most tools offer somekind of building tool for development to create the final static website product.

Back to our definition, we consider additional resources fetched from server by the page during rendetion is still inside this boundary.

Modern search engines, the spider-bots, works in accordance to this principle when crawling, fetching, and evaluating page content (keyword: Fetch and Render (AFD)).

Annexdesk offers a "no-build" approach. This mean you just include the fanstatic script, structure your files, and utilize the available methods, and view the result on the browser.

<script>
	return {
		renderer: "markdown"
	}
</script>
